<h1>Question 1.</h1>

The file “folate.txt” contains data on red cell folate levels (folate) in patients receiving three different methods of ventilation (ventilation) during anesthesia. The three different methods are coded as follows:

<ul>

 <li>= 35-50% oxygen given continuously for 24 hours</li>

 <li>= 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen given continuously for 24 hours.</li>

 <li>= 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen given only during the operation.</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>Plot the data, and summarise the information available from the plot</li>

 <li>Fit a model to compare the folate for different ventilation methods. Produce and inter-pret the summary table of coefficients</li>

 <li>There is one pairwise comparison that cannot be tested explicitly by referring to thetable of coefficients. Create a contrast that allows for that comparison. You should also create a second contrast to complete an <em>orthogonal </em>

  <ul>

   <li>State the null hypothesis corresponding to each of these contrasts, in words andusing statistical notation. <em>[5 marks]</em></li>

   <li>Verify that the two contrasts form an orthogonal set.</li>

   <li>Rerun the model by partitioning the SS for ventilation using the two</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>

contrasts. Produce and interpret relevant output.

<h1>Question 2.</h1>

A factorial experiment was conducted to investigate the yield (BYIELD) of barley. Thirty-six plots were divided into four blocks (BBLOCK). Three varieties (BVARIETY) were compared at three different row spacings (BSPACE). The data are stored in <strong>Data File: </strong>Barley.txt

<ul>

 <li>Produce two exploratory data plots. With reference to the plots, describe how the meansmay vary with variety and spacing. What statistical model is suggested?</li>

</ul>




<ul>

 <li>Fit a model that includes all main effects and the interaction between variety and spacing.Produce relevant outputs and assess whether the interaction is significant. Write an <em>informative </em>summary that relates to the context of the question.</li>

</ul>
